# SGE-Topical-Authority-Schema
Case study and code for an advanced JSON-LD Schema to achieve Topical Authority and rank in Google's SGE.
Advanced Schema for SGE & Topical Authority
This repository showcases the exact JSON-LD Schema markup I engineered for a pillar page (/cidade/goiania) to establish deep topical authority and achieve a featured position in Google's AI Overviews (SGE).
This is not a standard plugin-generated schema. It's a custom-built, strategic implementation designed to communicate expertise directly to Google's algorithms.
The Strategy: Why This Code Works

This markup leverages several advanced concepts:
@graph Structure: Instead of single entities, I use @graph to define multiple, interconnected entities on the same page. This provides a richer, more complete context for search engines.
Pillar & Cluster Model (hasPart / isPartOf): The main Article schema explicitly tells Google that it "hasPart" (tem parte) - a series of cluster articles. This structurally defines the pillar page as the authority hub for the topic "Goi√¢nia".

Comprehensive FAQPage: The extensive FAQ section directly answers the most common user questions, making the content a prime candidate for SGE features and People Also Ask boxes.
Entity Nesting: The City entity is nested within the main Article, creating a strong semantic connection between the content and the geographical entity it's about.
The Code: pillar-page-schema.jsonld
This is the full JSON-LD script implemented on the pillar page.

The Result üèÜ
This structured data was a key factor in achieving a featured spot in Google's AI Overviews (SGE) in under 20 days, proving the effectiveness of a data-first, technically sound SEO strategy.
